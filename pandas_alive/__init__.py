""" Create stunning, animated visualisations with matplotlib and pandas as easy as 'df.plot_animated()'.

Initialise Pandas_Alive functions as an accessor on Pandas DataFrames eg `df.plot_animated()`.
Registers plot_animated as an accessor for Pandas DataFrames and Series.

# POSSIBLE LINK PLOTTING.PY docs here

Must begin with a pandas DataFrame containing 'wide' data where:

- Every row represents a single period of time
- Each column holds the value for a particular category
- The index contains the time component (optional)
